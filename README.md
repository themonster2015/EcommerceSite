Production-Ready Rails Application

## **Important Concepts**

In developing this application I have gained critical experience with:

- MVC, RESTful and object-oriented design patterns
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Form validation
- Pagination with  [will\_paginate](https://github.com/zeitchef/pishop/blob/master)
- Authentication with  [Devise](https://github.com/zeitchef/pishop/blob/master)
- Authorization with  [CanCanCan](https://github.com/zeitchef/pishop/blob/master)
- Test-driven development with  [RSpec](https://github.com/zeitchef/pishop/blob/master)
- System security with  [brakeman](https://github.com/zeitchef/pishop/blob/master)
- System caching and performance optimization with  [Memcached](https://github.com/zeitchef/pishop/blob/master) and  [Redis](https://github.com/zeitchef/pishop/blob/master)
